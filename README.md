Rename Subtitle

This code renames your subtitle file names to your video file names so you don't need to do it manually

Note: It only works for series with '\*E(episode number)\*.mkv' pattern in their names and each season should be in a separate folder

GUIDE:

Step 1: install python

Step 2: copy the subtitle.py file to your directory

Step 3: Run the subtitle.py: 'python subtitle.py'
